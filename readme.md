A utility for encrypting files using a password and decrypting files encrypted with it.

## About

I made this for myself initially and decided to put it here for people that might want to use it.

Any changes are welcome if they:

1. Improve security
2. Improve accessibility
3. Make code more compliant with the standards

## Security

I assumed security was "_good enough for me_" but if you are planning on using this for any serious projects and don't know anything about cryptography, **DON'T USE THIS**. For anyone that understands cryptography, you probably know more than me. So any help from you will help.
